            <description>Me I&amp;rsquo;m just a computer science guy that likes graphics and music.
This Blog This blog was created mostly to kill some time and write some stuff, so I don&amp;rsquo;t really expect to get attention or many readers. Most posts here will probably be about computer graphics or any other thing I get interested in.
The Content I don&amp;rsquo;t know man, interesting stuff to you, I hope.</description>
