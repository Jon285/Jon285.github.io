      <description>Me I&amp;rsquo;m just a computer science guy that likes graphics and music.
This Blog This blog was created mostly to kill some time and write some stuff, so I don&amp;rsquo;t really expect to get attention or many readers. Most posts here will probably be about computer graphics or any other thing I get interested in.
The Content I don&amp;rsquo;t know man, interesting stuff to you, I hope.</description>

      <description>Me? I&amp;rsquo;m just another boring computer science student that started programming at his teenage years and ended up sucked by the rabbit hole.
What do I do? I study CS, mostly computer graphics, but also compiler construction, operating systems and systems programming as a whole. I also study music by myself and play guitar.
More about me? Well&amp;hellip;
 21 yo. Live in Brazil. Hate webdev. Aiming to get a degree in CS at the University of Bras√≠lia.</description>
